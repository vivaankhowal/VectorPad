# VectorPad
The VectorPad is my own custom branded Macropad to help with automating a few things around my house and daily keyboard tasks. I tried to fit as much potential in this Macropad as possible for the most amount of features. It has 9 MX Key switches plus some diodes for a matrix, a rotary encoder, a 0.91 in OLED screen, and the Seeeduino XIAO RP2040 as the microcontroller.

# Firmware
Uses basic KMK Firmware and haven't figured out the features for each control yet. Probably will figure it out once I actually build this board.
